          <h3>Artist's Statement</h3>
          <blockquote>
            <p>My creative endeavors start with a simple question:</p>

            <p>“What happens if?”</p>

            <p>While only three words, its brevity obscures a profound depth. It is the source of new ideas, fresh techniques, and many “…well, that didn't quite go as planned” experiences. It's the curiosity and the questions it invites that draw me back to my studio, day after day.</p>

            <p>My work is an exploration of the external world and my inner self. The paintings, sculptures, instruments, and objects I fabricate weave together natural and synthetic elements. It is in these fusions that I give form to answers I discover.</p>

          <h3>About Ben</h3>
          <p>Born in South Pasadena, California, Ben started producing art at an early age. His first job at his family’s cabinet shop exposed him to how natural materials and production techniques could be applied to design with form and function in mind. Later, he studied Architecture at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, California, and after a relocation to the East Coast, ultimately graduated from George Mason University in Virginia (B.A. Arts and Visual Technology - Graphic Design.)</p>
          <p>His design and artistic skills were put to use as a graphic and software designer before he was drawn back to work as an interdisciplinary artist. He lives in Northern Virginia, where he has a home studio, and travels to his Los Angeles studio to create his large-scale works.</p>
          <p>Ben’s works are recognized for their contemporary styles, with many of his works focused on abstraction with mixed media and materials prominently featured. As someone who is always experimenting, Ben has developed innovative painting and fabrication techniques to capture the colors, textures, and movement that exist in the world.</p>
          <p>Ben's works present a captivating exploration of texture and color, drawing inspiration from geological formations and aerial landscapes. The vibrant hues and interplay between opacity and translucency in many of the pieces evoke natural phenomena such as volcanic eruptions, the aurora borealis, or coral reefs submerged in deep waters, inviting viewers to delve into the depths of each painting to discover meaning or simply enjoy the beauty of the dynamic juxtaposition of colors.</p>

        <div>
          <h3>Exploratory Techniques</h3>
          <p>To bring organic and unexpected textures to his painted works, Ben makes use of the power of fire. Working with wet paint, alcohol dyes, and flammable solvents, Ben applies a flame to work in a technique he calls “pyrotexturing.”</p>
          <p>The blistering, charring, and chemical reactions that occur on his wooden panels are refined through hundreds of layers of pigment to evolve works which convey a strong emotional resonance, feeling simultaneously ancient and immediate, suggesting a deep connection to the subject matter, with each painted form carrying a sense of purpose and passion. As a collection, Ben's works stand as a testament to the transformative power of abstract expression, inviting viewers on an introspective journey as they engage with each piece.</p>
          <div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/927588995?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" title="Wildfire Morning - Creation Clip"></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>
          <p style="padding-top: 2em;">There's a sense of controlled chaos, a dance between intention and happenstance that gives each piece a life of its own. Some works suggest a celestial theme with what resembles starscapes and cosmic dust clouds, while others remind the viewer of the Earth's beauty, with rust-like textures suggesting decay and rebirth. Challenging observers to consider both macro and micro perspectives, Ben communicates a powerful reverence for nature's complexity, its fierce beauty, and its enduring mystery.</p>
